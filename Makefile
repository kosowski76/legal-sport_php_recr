# -e 			- instructs bash to immediately exit if any command has a non-zero exit status
# -u 			- a reference to any variable you haven't previously defined - with the exceptions of $* and $@ - is an error
# -o pipefail 	- if any command in a pipeline fails, that return code will be used as the return code
#				  of the whole pipeline. By default, the pipeline's return code is that of the last command - even if it succeeds.

# -c            - Read and execute commands from string after processing the options. Otherwise, arguments are treated  as filed. Example:
#                 bash -c "echo foo" # will excecute "echo foo"
#                 bash "echo foo"    # will try to open the file named "echo foo" and execute it
